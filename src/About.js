      <p>
        Hey, I'm Trevor &mdash; a software developer and student at the University of Waterloo.
        Currently, I'm working at Sun Life Financial as a DevOps Engineer, and will be transitioning
        to a Data &amp; Analytics (Big Data) development role in May 2021.
        I've worked in the past as a software developer, and that is my primary/preferred role, but I am
        flexible &mdash; I excel at all development roles.
        My current passions are low-powered embedded systems &amp; machine learning. I believe that
        combining these two fields will be the future of the computer science industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work &amp; school, some of my passions include football &mdash; I'm a childhood Manchester United
        fan, and I build custom mechanical keyboards in my spare time (Feel free to ask me more
        about these!). These hobbies also inspire some of my more casual <a href="#projects">projects</a>.
        I'm also an ex-musician and pilot, and I enjoy cooking &amp; exploring nature during my down time.
      </p>
