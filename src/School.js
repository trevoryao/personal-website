        I'm in my 2A term at
        the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">University of Waterloo</a> in
        Ontario, Canada. I am majoring in Computer Science, with a minor in Pure Mathematics. I am currently on
        two consecutive work terms due to the COVID-19 pandemic and course-selection timings. My current major
        average is 92%.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best courses that I have taken
        is <a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246e/F20/outline.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CS 246E</a>,
        which is an enriched/advanced version of CS 246. The course focuses on the abstractions that power object-oriented
        programming, covering a broad range of OOP and C++ topics, including generic programming, inheritance, and
        template metaprogramming.
